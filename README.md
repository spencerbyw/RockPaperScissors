## Overview

RockPaperScissors is a simple Ruby implementation of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". Perhaps you have heard of it?

The program uses some simple artificial intelligence to decide on its next move based on research outlined and linked-to [here](http://gizmodo.com/science-has-finally-figured-out-how-to-win-rock-paper-s-1571019588). I took it as an opportunity to have some fun with the idea, play around with the logic, and practice Ruby, of course.

Improvements are welcome, as well as corrections. Let me know what I can do better!
